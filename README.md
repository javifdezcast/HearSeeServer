# HearSeeServer
This is the backend service for the HearSee app. It was programmed in python and uses Google's Vertex API and TTS API to analyse images, and create small audio descriptions.

The AI model used is one of the biggest limitations to the usefullness of this app. Trials were done on OpenAI's GPT4 model but since no free credit is given to students and Google Cloud also offers hosting services, the later was chosen. Improvements in the model, the image processing, maybe compression and other techniques, would be the following steps to improve the service.
